I'm a senior at Union College, studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
I'm based in Schenectady, NY and will be graduating in June of 2024.
With a passion for problem solving, I've developed a skillset in
systems and full stack development. 
I've gained professional experience in a lab setting and in a small private
team, where I learned to develop at scale and create solutions
geared towards client needs.
I approach each project as an opportunity to develop my skillset through
iterative design.
When I'm not programming, I like to play chess, read books, and hike.
Contact me with the form at the bottom of the page; I look forward to hearing
from you!
