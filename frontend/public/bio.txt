I'm a senior at Union College, studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
I'm based in Schenectady, NY and will be graduating this June (2024).
Over the last four years, I've become adept in
various programming languages, development environments, and specialized domains. 
I've gained professional experience in a lab, supply chain management company, and 
large public organization bringing software solutions to users.
I approach each project and professional endeavor as an opportunity to develop
my skillset through iterative, focused design.
When I'm not programming, I like to play chess, read books, and hike.
Contact me with the form at the bottom of the page; I look forward to hearing
from you!
