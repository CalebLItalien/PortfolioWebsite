In February 2024, I will embark on an exciting journey as a Junior Mainframe Systems Developer at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, where I will be leveraging my skills in systems development as a COBOL developer. This position represents a significant step in my career, allowing me to apply my academic knowledge in lower level programming in a practical, real-world setting. This opportunity is particularly exciting as it allows me to delve deep into the world of mainframe computing, an area that is both challenging and crucial for many industries. I look forward to contributing my problem-solving skills and gaining invaluable experience in a field that is foundational to modern computing.
Between June 2023 and September 2023, I worked in a fast-paced business environment with a legacy codebase. I directly deployed client needs to cloud instances using TypeScript, Angular, MongoDB and AWS EC2. I started by building new features, including label generators, Microsoft Outlook integration, and permissions management; by the end of my internship, I was overhauling existing API routes, building robust middleware, and automating internal business tasks using Express.js and Node.js. I worked in a small team of developers to develop an application that was used internationally. 
Between September 2022 and the present, I’ve worked in a large lab to simulate soft robotics movement in a 2D environment. The goal of the team is to discover unique movement strategies for soft robots in difficult terrains. Through this team, I’ve helped optimize genetic algorithms for calculating ideal movement strategies, implemented Docker containerization, configured VMware setups for Ubuntu Linux virtual machines, and managed resource allocation using Chameleon cloud services.
