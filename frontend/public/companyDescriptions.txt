As a student assistant at NY Department of Tax and Finance, I've been training to be a part of the NY Systems Modernization Program. The program will convert legacy JCL and COBOL programs to Java applications, while maintaining existing functionality with no downtime. I take part in the Systems Development Life Cycle, reviewing JCL and COBOL programs while maintaining Tax and Finance Standards.
I worked as a full stack developer for an international medical supply chain management company over the summer of 2023. There, I enhanced core functionalities and completed user tickets using JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, MongoDB, and AWS EC2. At the beginning of my internship, I was building new features, including label generators, Microsoft Outlook integration, and permissions management; by the end, I was refactoring API routes to be RESTful, building robust middleware, and automating internal data entry processes using Express.js and Node.js. 
I worked as a Robotics Research assistant at Union College to discover soft robotics movement strategies in a 2D environment. On this team, Iâ€™ve helped optimize memory performance of genetic algorithms, automate Docker containerization, manage resource allocation using Chameleon cloud services, and prepare research data for publication.
