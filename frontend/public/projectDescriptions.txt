The website you’re currently viewing can be generated by anyone, with no coding experience required. The goal of the project is to help people applying for software-related jobs, who need a personal website to display their skills and experience without wanting to dive into web development. The project utilizes TypeScript, Angular, Rust, Docker, and AWS. A user can simply run a bash script to set up the project, do edits, or prepare a Docker image for deployment. Further, I’ve designed the SMTP server to work with a user’s no reply email and personal email (for the contact card). 
For a class on Operating Systems, I worked in a team of three to develop an operating system. We began by implementing data structures and synchronization primitives. These tools helped build the basis for system calls, memory management, thread to process mapping, and process scheduling/management. While we all worked together on the project, I was primarily responsible for the process to thread mapping, process management, and the following system calls: fork(), waitpid(), getpid(), and exit().
